"""Theme switching exercised against the real widget tree.

Runs headlessly with the ``offscreen`` Qt platform plugin, so no display
is needed. These tests build a real MainWindow because the point is that
live switching reaches every widget: a stylesheet swap alone leaves
hand-styled widgets on the old colours, and only the assembled window can
show that.

The window is given a MemoryVault rather than a real one. DesktopRuntime
calls ``Storage.save_credentials`` during startup, which writes to the OS
credential store, so using the real Vault would leave a device token in
the developer's keyring every time the suite ran.
