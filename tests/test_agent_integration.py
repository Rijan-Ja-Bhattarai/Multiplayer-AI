"""End-to-end: client -> Connection Server -> Agent Gateway -> relay -> agent.

This exercises the chain in agent.md sections 12 to 16 with real
components: a real relay on a real socket, a real ``AgentClient`` holding
an agent, and a real client WebSocket on the Connection Server. Nothing
here is mocked, so it proves the two applications actually fit together
rather than that each merely looks right in isolation.

The relay's own behaviour is covered by ``tests/test_network.py``; this
file is only about the client-facing integration.
