"""The Agent Gateway: the only component that talks to the agent relay.

agent.md section 14 draws the boundary this module implements::

    Message Router
           |
           v
     Agent Gateway
           |
           v
        A2A / relay
           |
           v
         Agent

The router decides *that* a message is for an agent. This module locates
the endpoint, performs the call, and translates the relay's replies into
the error codes the client protocol defines. No client-envelope handling
and no WebSocket logic belongs here.

Transport
---------
The relay exposes ``POST /agents/{agent}/invoke``, which accepts an
arbitrary JSON payload and returns an arbitrary JSON result. The Gateway
uses that rather than speaking the relay's peer WebSocket protocol: the
peer protocol is for devices hosting an agent, whereas the Gateway is
itself just a caller.

Correlation
-----------
An HTTP invoke is synchronous, so the response is correlated to the
request by the call itself. agent.md section 15 warns against assuming
agent responses are always synchronous. That seam is left open on
purpose: :meth:`AgentGateway.invoke` is async and returns the agent's
payload, so an asynchronous push path can be added beside it later
without changing the router.
