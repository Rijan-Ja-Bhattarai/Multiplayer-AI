"""Connection Server: the client-facing entry point.

Serves two things:

* ``GET /health`` — a liveness probe that deliberately does not depend on
  any agent being reachable (agent.md section 6).
* ``WebSocket /ws/{client_id}`` — the persistent client connection that
  carries all client-to-client messaging (section 7).

Routing lives in :mod:`src.routing.router`; this module owns transport
only: accept frames, hand them to the router, and report failures back to
the sender as structured errors.
