"""In-memory registry of connected clients.

The Connection Server keeps a live WebSocket per connected client and
tracks who is present. This is deliberately in-memory only: agent.md
section 7 says not to add a database until something actually needs one.

The registry owns delivery to a client socket. Routing decides *where* a
message goes; the registry is the only place that writes to a WebSocket.
