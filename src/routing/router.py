"""The single routing decision point for client-facing messages.

agent.md section 20 asks for one clearly identifiable routing component
rather than routing decisions scattered across unrelated modules, so
every inbound message funnels through :func:`route_message`.

The shape of the decision (section 20)::

    Incoming Message
           |
        Validate
           |
       Read Destination
           |
           +-- destination.type == client --> Client Registry --> WebSocket
           |
           +-- destination.type == agent  --> Agent Gateway --> A2A

Both branches are implemented. The agent branch holds no HTTP or relay
detail of its own (section 29): it hands the payload to the Agent Gateway
and converts the returned payload into the normalised response envelope
from section 16.
