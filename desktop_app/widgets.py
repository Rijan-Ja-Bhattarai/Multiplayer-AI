    """One message: its speaker's mark, its bubble, and the actions beneath it.

    The actions are always there and sit under the bubble, the way a browser
    assistant keeps a copy button under every reply. They used to occupy a
    slot beside the mark and appear only on hover, which was wrong twice
    over: it read as a pop-up, and it moved the message, because a hidden
    widget hands its space back to the layout, so revealing the actions took
    about 90px off the bubble and re-wrapped the text under the pointer.

    ``mine`` is the reader's own message. It puts the bubble and the mark on
    the right of the panel and the stretch on the left, rather than the other
    way round, so both sides of the conversation are built from one row.

    The row is a widget rather than a layout because ``:hover`` in a
    stylesheet matches widgets, and a bare layout has nothing to match on.
