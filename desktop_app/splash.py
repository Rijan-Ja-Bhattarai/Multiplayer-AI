"""The launch screen: the app's first impression, and its first chance to lie.

A splash screen is the one piece of UI whose failure is invisible. If it
never goes away the app looks hung; if it leaves early you glimpse an
unpainted window; and if it stays up over an error it hides that error
behind a smiling logo. So three things are handled rather than hoped for:

* It waits for the runtime to report ready, but never for less than a
  floor. Startup here takes about a quarter of a second, so waiting only
  for readiness would flash a splash for a fifth of a second and read as a
  glitch rather than as an intention.
* A fatal error tears it down at once. Nothing should be able to leave a
  logo on screen over a broken app.
* It is skipped when the stored preferences say so, and when the
  reduce-motion setting is on, since an accessibility switch that let an
  animation play anyway would not be doing its job.

The mark and the orbit are the ones the welcome panel already uses, so the
app introduces itself with what the user is about to see rather than with
a second drawing of it.
