        Set explicitly rather than left to the layout's size policy. A bubble
        has to be told where to stop or one long line runs off the edge, and
        it has to be told how big it is as well: relying on the box layout
        inside a freshly built row left it at the widget's default 640x480,
        which is the full-bleed slab this replaced.

        The width is ``min(preferred, limit)``: a short reply gets the width of
        its text and reads as a bubble, a long one gets the ceiling and wraps.

        The height is worked out from each child's own idea of its height, not
        read back from the bubble. Both obvious readings are wrong:

        ``column.sizeHint()`` reports whatever the column is currently laid out
        at, and the height used to be pinned from that reading. Once pinned, the
        column's hint reports the pin back, so the pin became its own input and
        the height could never change again. A message laid out at a wide panel
        kept that height, and narrowing the panel re-wrapped the text into a
        bubble far too short for it, cutting off the bottom of the message.

        Reading a child's ``height()`` is wrong too. A plain label in a fresh row
        still has whatever height it was last given, which is the widget
        default, so a one-line title came out hundreds of pixels tall. So each
        kind is asked the way it decides for itself: a Markdown reply works its
        height out from its text, a wrapped label from ``heightForWidth`` at the
        width it has just been given, and a plain label from its size hint.

        The pin goes back on at the end, because the scrolling panel squeezes
        its rows to fit rather than scrolling them, which left every bubble one
        line high. It is set from what the children actually need, so it holds
        the text rather than cutting it.
