    # settings rather than inside any workspace, because a workspace
    # deletion removes its own directory.

    # atomically and read defensively: a corrupt file is dropped rather
    # than allowed to block startup. It is not trusted to name an arbitrary
    # entry, because that would let a hand-edited file delete a credential
    # the app is still using.
